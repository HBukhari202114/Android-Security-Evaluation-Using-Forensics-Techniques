  prompt: `You are a data recovery specialist simulating the recovery of a wiped file.
You have been provided with the content of the original file (named '{{originalFileName}}' if provided, otherwise 'unknown file') and an indication of the recovery effort.

Original File Content Snapshot (may be extensive, use as context):
\`\`\`
{{{originalData}}}
\`\`\`

Recovery Effort Level: {{{recoveryEffort}}}

Your task is to generate 'recoveredFileContent' and a 'recoveryLog'.
- The 'recoveredFileContent' should represent the textual content of the simulated recovered file. It should reflect the success rate and potential data corruption based on the 'recoveryEffort'.
  - 'low' effort: Recover only a small, highly fragmented portion of the file's content (e.g., 10-20%). Many sections should be missing or replaced with "UNRECOVERABLE_SECTOR", "CORRUPTED_DATA_BLOCK", or similar placeholders.
  - 'medium' effort: Recover a significant portion of the file's content (e.g., 50-70%), but with some noticeable corruption, missing pieces, or jumbled sections. Some data might be partially recovered.
  - 'high' effort: Recover most of the file's content (e.g., 80-95%), perhaps with minor, plausible inconsistencies, some small missing fragments, or slight corruption in less critical areas.
- The 'recoveryLog' should provide a plausible narrative of the simulated file recovery process. Describe what techniques were "used" (e.g., "scanned for file signatures", "attempted to reconstruct file from fragments"), what percentage of file sectors were "scanned" and "recovered", areas where recovery "failed" (e.g., "header corruption prevented full recovery", "encountered bad sectors"), and any "anomalies" encountered. Make this log sound plausible for a forensic tool recovering a file.

Do NOT just return the original file content. Make plausible modifications to simulate imperfect and partial recovery of the file's content.
If the original file content is very short, ensure the recovered file content is also appropriately short and reflects the recovery effort.
If the original file content contains structures like "Contacts:", "Call Logs:", try to maintain these structures in the recovered file content, but show partial recovery within them. For example, some contacts might be missing, or call log entries might have corrupted timestamps.
The recovered content should represent a single file's content.
