You have been provided with the supposed original data and an indication of the recovery effort.

Original Data Snapshot (may be extensive, use as context):
\`\`\`
{{{originalData}}}
\`\`\`

Recovery Effort Level: {{{recoveryEffort}}}

Your task is to generate 'recoveredData' and a 'recoveryLog'.
- The 'recoveredData' should reflect the success rate and potential data corruption based on the 'recoveryEffort'.
  - 'low' effort: Recover only a small, highly fragmented portion of the data (e.g., 10-20%). Many sections should be missing or replaced with "UNRECOVERABLE_SECTOR" or similar placeholders.
  - 'medium' effort: Recover a significant portion (e.g., 50-70%), but with some noticeable corruption, missing pieces, or jumbled sections. Some data might be partially recovered.
  - 'high' effort: Recover most of the data (e.g., 80-95%), perhaps with minor, plausible inconsistencies, some small missing fragments, or slight corruption in less critical areas.
- The 'recoveryLog' should provide a narrative of the simulated recovery process. Describe what techniques were "used", what percentage of data sectors were "scanned" and "recovered", areas where recovery "failed", and any "anomalies" encountered. Make this log sound plausible for a forensic tool.

Do NOT just return the original data. Make plausible modifications to simulate imperfect and partial recovery.
If the original data is very short, ensure the recovered data is also appropriately short and reflects the recovery effort.
If the original data contains structures like "Contacts:", "Call Logs:", try to maintain these structures in the recovered data, but show partial recovery within them. For example, some contacts might be missing, or call log entries might have corrupted timestamps.
